Matrices Calculator

                                                                Main
Start by setting the size of both Matrix1 and Matrix2's row and column.  
Then you get to choose whether you want to fill your matrixes with random integers or fill them with your own custom integers.  If you choose to make it random, the program choose numbers between 0 and 101(exlusively).  If you choose to personally fill it with your own integers, then the computer will prompt you to fill in the matrix with the number you want at the given element.

You are able to three different calculations in this program. 

                                                              Addition
It only works if Matrix1 and Matrix2 have an equal number of rows and columns.  If Matrix1's rows/columns and Matrix2's rows/columns are not equal, then an error will be thrown.  Takes an element from Matrix1 and adds it to the corresponding element in Matrix2.  Returns the added matrix.

                                                              Subtraction
It is the same as addition except instead of adding the elements from the Matrixes, it subtracts them.  Returns the subtracted matrix.

                                                              Multiplication
First thing it has to check for is to make sure that either Matrix1's row and Matrix2's column are equal or vice versa.  The program checks to see Matrix1 row is smaller than Matrix2 row and if Matrix1 column is greater than Matrix2 column.  If it is, then you run the calculations with Matrix1 rows multiplying by Matrix2 columns.  If not, then it runs the calulations with Matrix2 rows multiplying by Matrix1 columns.  Returns the multiplied matrix.

The program lets you choose which calculations you wish to make.  You can make more than one if you wish.  Once you are done with the calculations, you will be able to terminate the program and then rerun it when you want to do a new calculation.
